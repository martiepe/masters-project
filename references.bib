	abstract = {The utilization distribution of an animal describes the relative probability of space use. It is natural to think of it as the long-term consequence of the animal's short-term movement decisions: it is the accumulation of small displacements which, over time, gives rise to global patterns of space use. However, many estimation methods for the utilization distribution either assume the independence of observed locations and ignore the underlying movement (e.g. kernel density estimation), or are based on simple Brownian motion movement rules (e.g. Brownian bridges). We introduce a new continuous-time model of animal movement, based on the Langevin diffusion. This stochastic process has an explicit stationary distribution, conceptually analogous to the idea of the utilization distribution, and thus provides an intuitive framework to integrate movement and space use. We model the stationary (utilization) distribution with a resource selection function to link the movement to spatial covariates, and allow inference about habitat preferences of animals. Standard approximation techniques can be used to derive the pseudo-likelihood of the Langevin diffusion movement model, and to estimate habitat preference and movement parameters from tracking data. We investigate the performance of the method on simulated data, and discuss its sensitivity to the time scale of the sampling. We present an example of its application to tracking data of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus. Due to its continuous-time formulation, this method can be applied to irregular telemetry data. The movement model is specified using a habitat-dependent utilization distribution, and it provides a rigorous framework to estimate long-term habitat selection from correlated movement data. The Langevin movement model can be written as a linear model, which allows for very fast inference. Standard tools such as residuals can be used for model checking.},

	abstract = {Sampling from various kinds of distribution is an issue of paramount importance in statistics since it is often the key ingredient for constructing estimators, test procedures or confidence intervals. In many situations, exact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally expensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling strategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in high dimensional problems. The paper makes some progress in this direction by considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and log-concave density defined on Rp, for some integer p \&gt; 0. We establish non-asymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the target distribution by the distribution obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its variants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with various experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of continuous time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the framework of log-concave densities that are considered in the present work.},

To perform parameter inference, the widely used Euler method is compared with two other pseudolikelihood procedures and with a Monte Carlo expectation–maximization approach based on exact simulation of diffusions. Performances of all methods are assessed with simulated data and with a data set of fishing vessel trajectories.

We then consider conditions under which the discrete approximations to the diffusion converge. We first show that even when the diffusion itself converges, naive discretizations need not do so. We then consider a 'Metropolis-adjusted' version of the algorithm, and find conditions under which this also converges at an exponential rate: perhaps surprisingly, even the Metropolized version need not converge exponentially fast even if the diffusion does. We briefly discuss a truncated form of the algorithm which, in practice, should avoid the difficulties of the other forms.},

	title = {Multiscale modelling of animal movement with persistent dynamics},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15195},
	abstract = {Wild animals are commonly fitted with trackers that record their position through time, to learn about their behaviour. Broadly, statistical models for tracking data often fall into two categories: local models focus on describing small-scale movement decisions, and global models capture large-scale spatial distributions. Due to this dichotomy, it is challenging to describe mathematically how animals’ distributions arise from their short-term movement patterns, and to combine data sets collected at different scales. We propose a multiscale model of animal movement and space use based on the underdamped Langevin process, widely used in statistical physics. The model is convenient to describe animal movement for three reasons: it is specified in continuous time (such that its parameters are not dependent on an arbitrary time scale), its speed and direction are autocorrelated (similarly to real animal trajectories), and it has a closed form stationary distribution that we can view as a model of long-term space use. We use the common form of a resource selection function for the stationary distribution, to model the environmental drivers behind the animal’s movement decisions. We further increase flexibility by allowing movement parameters to be time-varying, e.g., to account for daily cycles in an animal’s activity. We formulate the model as a state-space model and present a method of inference based on the Kalman filter. The approach requires discretising the continuous-time process, and we use simulations to investigate performance for various time resolutions of observation. The approach works well at fine resolutions, though the estimated stationary distribution tends to be too flat when time intervals between observations are very long.},

	abstract = {Data integration, the joint statistical analysis of data from different observation platforms, is pivotal for data-hungry disciplines such as spatial ecology. Pooled data types obtained from the same underlying process, analyzed jointly, can improve both precision and accuracy in models of species distributions and species–habitat associations. However, the integration of telemetry and spatial survey data has proved elusive because of the fundamentally different analytical approaches required by these two data types. Here, “spatial survey” denotes a survey that records spatial locations and has no temporal structure, for example, line or point transects but not capture–recapture or telemetry. Step selection functions (SSFs—the canonical framework for telemetry) and habitat selection functions (HSFs—the default approach to spatial surveys) differ in not only their specifications but also their results. By imposing the constraint that microscopic mechanisms (animal movement) must correctly scale up to macroscopic emergence (population distributions), a relationship can be written between SSFs and HSFs, leading to a joint likelihood using both datasets. We implement this approach using maximum likelihood, explore its estimation precision by systematic simulation, and seek to derive broad guidelines for effort allocation in the field. We find that complementarities in spatial coverage and resolution between telemetry and survey data often lead to marked inferential improvements in joint analyses over those using either data type alone. The optimal allocation of effort between the two methods (or the choice between them, if only one can be selected) depends on the overall effort expended and the pattern of environmental heterogeneity. Examining inferential performance over a broad range of scenarios for the relative cost between the two methods, we find that integrated analysis usually offers higher precision. Our methodological work shows how to integrate the analysis of telemetry and spatial survey data under a novel joint likelihood function, using traditional computational methods. Our simulation experiments suggest that even when the relative costs of the two methods favor the deployment of one field approach over another, their joint use is broadly preferable. Therefore, joint analysis of the two key methods used in spatial ecology is not only possible but also computationally efficient and statistically more powerful.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents a sound insight into the theory of nonlinear filtering for continuous–discrete stochastic systems whose process models are of a continuous-time fashion, whereas the measurement ones in use are discrete time. In particular, it gives precise definitions and explains all basic issues and notions of state estimation in nonlinear Gaussian systems of such sort. A special emphasis is placed on two extended Kalman filtering design approaches and on their practical implementation aspects since these can expose instabilities in solving real-world state estimation tasks because of the linearization, discretization and rounding operations implemented in computer-based simulations. Under some circumstances, such numerical integration and round-off errors committed may affect severely the calculation and result in non-symmetric and / or indefinite covariance matrices yielded, which compromise the theoretical rigor of the extended Kalman filtering and produce state estimates of poor accuracy. This chapter pays its particular attention to the issue of numerical stability and presents a remedy for treating such a covariance-matrix-symmetry-and-positivity-loss in the fashion of square-root filtering. Two specific square-rooting techniques grounded on the Cholesky factorization and {SVD} are considered and justified, here. The theoretical analysis of extended Kalman filters under exploration, which are summarized in the kind of concise pseudo-codes situated in Appendix of this chapter, is supported with illustrative calculations performed in {MATLAB}.},

	abstract = {A long-standing goal in ecology is to describe an animal's home range or utilization density (UD) without complete knowledge of the animal's movement. There are a number of methods available to calculate a UD from telemetry data, but the most common methods limit the UD to cover areas where the animal was observed during tracking, and do not account for preferential use of different habitats (resource selection). The limiting distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) matches the intuitive understanding of a UD for an animal following a CTMC movement model. By modelling continuous-time movement through discrete-gridded space we can infer environmental effects on animal movement and then predict a UD over the desired spatial area that captures preferential use of space. The r packages crawl and ctmcmove allow ecologists to use telemetry data to predict the UD of an animal using the limiting distribution of a CTMC movement model. We used data collected from Steller sea lions in Alaska to illustrate use of this method for investigating range-wide space use. Our findings show how these packages, and this method, can aid our understanding of space-use by predicting use outside the areas where animals were observed, avoiding barriers to movement, including environmental covariates and removing the release effect of telemetry studies. These results will be important for both conservation and management, particularly when determining critical habitat designation.},

	abstract = {Authenticating audio songs/signals is one of the challenging issues in the domain of audio processing and analysis. Different techniques like embedding secret code in amplitude or frequency components, harmonics alternation, embedding audio/image, etc. are frequently used by the researchers for audio signal authentication. In this paper, an approach has been made to authenticate audio signal through bicubic interpolation. Bicubic interpolation is applied over songs to incorporate small changes in some speciﬁc positions and correlates with other sampled values without any major alternation in audible quality of signals. It is then molded into a suitable form within tolerable range of controlling parameters of audio quality to embed secure data/another strip of audio signal to identify it uniquely among collection of similar audio songs. A comparative study is given with similar existing techniques. Experimental results are computed based on Microsoft WAVE (“.wav”) stereo sound ﬁle, and performances are analyzed which show optimal performances compared to the existing techniques.},
